#summary Progress so far

= Progress =

So far, we have implemented a simple contrast-based image segmentation algorithm.  This is to confirm our codebase is well-formed.

We now have the capability to load and store multiple TIFF images, as well as perform the algorithmic computations on these images in memory.

See [http://code.google.com/p/motion-segmentation/downloads/list Here] for resulting output.
The [http://www.xvid.org/Downloads.15.0.html XviD] decoder is needed to play the videos.
